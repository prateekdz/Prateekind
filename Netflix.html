  <h3 class="Head">The rise and fall of Netflix.</h3>
  <div>
  <p class="Space">Let's talk about the strategies behind the rise and fall of Netflix.
   <br>

    The backstory: they beat Blockbuster, made a cultural shift that grew their business by $300B+, then lost ~60% of their valuation.
  <br>
    We'll talk about what you can learn from how Netflix injected strategy into their culture, give you the dead-simple frameworks Netflix used to grow, and help you avoid their mistakes.

   <h4 class="Head"> Netflix feels competitors closing in. They need a change</h4>

   <div class="Space">
<p >
    Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO, had just overcome the threat from Blockbuster with their  new business model: the DVDs by mail business.
    <p>
    They begin to feel pressure from much larger competitors: Google, Amazon, Time Warner, and Apple.
 <p>
Netflix needs to make a drastic change to survive.
<p>
Up until this point, most of the focus was on exceptional execution, but execution without strategy puts them at risk to be wiped out.
<p>
"Strategy" is a dirty word
Reed knows he needs a strategy, but he's an execution guy.
<p>
He hates how complicated traditional, "ivory tower," strategy is. He hates that it's magically created by senior leaders behind closed doors and pushed down to the rest of the company.
<p>
Reed doesn't want this at his company. But to help Netflix survive the competitive pressure and grow into an iconic company, he needs change.
<p>
He decides he to find a strategy framework that's simple and that he can embed into the culture at every level.
<p>
Hamilton Helmer and the 7 Powers
Reed finds Hamilton Helmer, a consultant on a mission to make strategy simple and pull it out of the ivory tower. Everyone deserves access and input into the company strategy.
<p>
Helmer agrees to help Reed, and brings his simple strategic framework to teach to the people at Netflix: his 7 Powers.
<p>
The Netflix-ers tell Reed that this training is the most transformational shift in thinking they've had in their career.
<p>
Netflix prioritizes driving the 7 Powers in to their culture.
<p>
Then, over the next 14 years, this new strategic culture drives $300B+ in growth.
<p>
So what are the 7 Powers?
7 Powers are ways to sustainably differentiate your business. It's your competitive moat.
<p>
When you're creating your strategy (click here for a previous issue on how to build your strategy - with a template included) be sure to include competitive moats to protect your business from competitors.
<p>
<h4> Here are the 7 Powers: </h4>
<p>
<p>
The fall of Netflix
Fast forward to 2021 and Netflix's valuation drops by ~$200B. How can this happen if they have such a strategically minded organization?
<p>
Factors that went into Netflix's crash
<p>
1) Increased competition
Netflix was first to the streaming market and took market share quickly. Now, there are too many different places to find video streaming content.
<p>
Netflix is struggling to differentiate and their value is decreasing in the minds of consumers. When more competitors come to market, differentiation becomes even more critical.
<p>
7 Powers is a critical exercise for differentiation. They previously won with counter-positioning (a better business model against Blockbuster) and cornered resources (proprietary Netflix shows).
<p>
Now, competitors are using the same Powers, and Netflix needs to refresh their strategy and target new Powers.
<p>
2) Increased prices (lost ~600k subscribers)
For customers accessing content on multiple platforms, the value of a Netflix subscription decreased. Then, Netflix increased the price of a subscription.
<p>
600,000 subscribers left when they felt the increased price was no longer worth the subscription.
<p>
Raise prices when your product's value is dropping and you'll lose customers. Differentiate and improve the value of the product before you increase prices.
<p>
3) Russia / Ukraine war
Netflix took a stance and pulled out of Russia. This was the right move in the long run, but cost them ~700k Russian subscribers.
<p>
Customers are more likely to buy from companies that take a stance.
<p>
How can you avoid a crash?
Let's start with a harsh truth:
<p>
Strategy greatly improves the odds you'll succeed, but doesn't guarantee it.
<p>
The world is too complex.
<p>
Strategy is also not a one-and-done process. Competitors change, industry forces change, you need to change with it and keep a competitive advantage.
<p>
So what do you do to increase your odds of success?
<p>
1) Refresh your strategy more frequently
Write down the factors that may impact your business and cause your strategy to change:
• Changing industry trends?
• New tech solutions?
• New competitors?
<p>
A changing landscape means you'll want to check in on your differentiation.
<p>
2) Scenario Plan for uncertainty
There's a separate strategy exercise for times that are exceptionally uncertain (e.g., COVID, Russia / Ukraine war, the changing streaming landscape).
<p>
Come up with the future possibilities, and develop a strategy for each. This process helps prepare your business for outcomes that could happen.
